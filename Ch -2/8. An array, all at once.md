## **Exercise**

- An array, all at once
  - In the previous exercises, you created and parameterized an array, then initialized it separately.
  - In this exercise, you'll experience performing all of these steps at once. The card variables you need are already defined.

## **Instructions**

- Create an array named `hands`.
- Initialize the first player's hand to `tenClubs + fourDiamonds`.
- Initialize the second player's hand to `nineSpades + nineHearts`.
- Initialize the third player's hand to `twoClubs + threeSpades`.

# ***Solution***

```
// Create, parameterize, and initialize an array for a round of Twenty-One
val hands = Array(tenClubs + fourDiamonds,
                  nineSpades + nineHearts,
                  twoClubs + threeSpades)
```
